# Introduction

Packup is web application bundler for [Deno][Deno], inspired by [parcel][parcel]. Packup connects your assets such as html, css, javascript and bundles them into static files. It also serves them dynamically when in development.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Bundles web application like [Parcel][Parcel].
- âœ¨ Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- ðŸ¦• Deno-compatible ES Modules resolution.
- ðŸ’¨ Fast build with [esbuild][esbuild]-wasm bundler.
- ðŸ”© Dev server builtin

Packup supports TypeScript out of the box, and provides type checked development environment along with [vscode deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno).

Packup doesn't support commonjs modules, instead it supports Deno compatible module resolution.

Packup uses [esbuild][esbuild] bundler internally to bundle your scripts, and it's very fast!
