# packup v0.0.12

[![ci](https://github.com/kt3k/packup/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kt3k/packup/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> Zero-config web application packager in [Deno][Deno].

‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is still in its early development stage.

# Features

- üì¶ Bundle web application like [Parcel][Parcel].
- ‚ú® Support TypeScript out of the box.
- ü¶ï Deno-compatible ES Modules resolution.
- üí® Fast build with [esbuild][esbuild]-wasm bundler.

# Usage

Install via deno.land/x:

```shell
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/packup@v0.0.12/install.ts
```

Write HTML and JavaScript:

index.html

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script src="./main.ts"></script>
  <h1>Hi from packup!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

main.ts

```js
console.log("hello world");
```

`packup` has the development server builtin. Run the following command to start
the server.

```
packup index.html
```

Then open http://localhost:1234/ in your browser.

See `packup serve -h` and `packup build -h` for more usages.

# Typings

You can type check the script with [Deno][Deno].

You need the following `tsconfig.json` for your frontend scripts correctly type
checked.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["esnext", "dom"]
  }
}
```

If you use vscode you need to set 'deno.config' property in
`.vscode/settings.json` file to point the tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.lint": true,
  "deno.unstable": true,
  "deno.config": "./tsconfig.json"
}
```

If you'd prefer to use CLI directly to type check your script, you can use the
following command for it:

```sh
deno cache --config tsconfig.json <script>
```

See [the example repository](https://github.com/kt3k/packup_example) for more
details.

## Done items

- [x] give the example of typings of the react + react-router +
  styled-components example
- [x] styled-components example
- [x] react router example
- [x] react example
- [x] --open support
- [x] Assets in `static/` dir are served/copied as is. (Use this for images and
  other assets.)
  - Something like https://github.com/elwin013/parcel-plugin-static-files-copy
- [x] livereload
- [x] optimize esbuild loading
- [x] --port support (serve)
- [x] --dist-dir support (build)
- [ ] Runs parcels original examples (with Deno specific stuff modification).
  - Doesn't work because it includes commonjs references which I don't want to
    support.
- [x] List asset sizes
- [x] Bundle javascript using esbuild
- [x] Bundle javascript using swc
- [x] `deno run cli.ts [serve] index.html` starts server at localhost port 1234,
  watch all dependencies, rebuild all assets when changed.
- [x] `deno run cli.ts build index.html` builds static assets to 'dist'
  directory.
- [x] Referenced scripts from `<script>` tags are bundled and served/built.
- [x] Stylesheets referenced from `<link />` tags are just served/copied as is.
